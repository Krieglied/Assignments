1 The general who became a slave
2 The slave who became a gladiator
3 The gladiator who defied an emperor
4 Striking story
5 But now the people want to know how the story ends
6 Only a famous death will do
7 And what could be more glorious than to challenge the Emperor himself in the great arena
8 You would fight me
9 Why not
10 Do you think I am afraid
11 I think youve been afraid all your life
12 Unlike Maximus the invincible who knows no fear
13 I knew a man who once said
14 Death smiles at us all
15 All a man can do is smile back
16 I wonder did your friend smile at his own death
17 You must know
18 He was your father
19 You loved my father I know
20 But so did I 
21 That makes us brothers doesnt it
22 Smile for me now brother
