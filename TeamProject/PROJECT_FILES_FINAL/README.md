# **DIRTY OLD RAT**

Project members: Smith, Krieser, Graham

This project was a colloborative effort to build a Remote Access Terminal (RAT), that would have two components.  

The first, a server program, would accept an IP address to connect to, send a message to establish connection, and be able to send commands to/receive input from the client.

The second, the client, would have two components itself.  A overhead program would run, in our example a game, which to a user on the machine would make the application seem more legitimate.  The user would be able to interact with the overhead game without interfering with the underlying program.
